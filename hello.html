<!-- Now I want to save these changes to the repository and repository isn't keeping track of every single character I write. I need to tell git that this is the state of my current files that I would like to keep track of, something that I would like to save -->

<!-- And in the world of git, we call those save points "COMMITS", when I say I am making a commit, I mean I would like to save the current state of all the files and folders and other assets that exists inside of the repository and basically take a SNAPSHOT of their current position such that later, I might be able to refer back to them, but in order to do that there are actually a couple of steps -->

<!-- So the first step we need to follow is an additional command, so we saw that git clone was the command we could use to clone the repository.-->

<!-- The next command we will take look at is GIT ADD.  -->




<!-- NOW I HAVE MADE A CHNGE TO THIS FILE, added a h1 -->
<!-- Now when i will run git status, it will say that changes not staged for commit, 
which means that first i will need to say 
"git add hello.html"

But there is a SHORTCUT, if you want to add all the files that have been changes and commit at the same time, the shorthand is 
" git commit -am "Add a heading" "   Here in "am" a stands for all and m stands for message 

This is how you can combine git add step and git commit step-->

<!-- And now if I run git status, it is going to tell that your branch is ahead of origin by 1 commit. -->

<!-- Then i will update the changes on server by using git push -->
